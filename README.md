# Shiny-App---Machien-Learning-and-Stats-

We created a highly reactive app, which gives you insights into any data set you to upload to
the app. The App can load data as a csv file, read data as a link, has inbuilt datasets and has
access to the YAHOO finance API. Due to this reason, this app can be used in general to get
insights into data and can give you future predictions.
The upper bar shows four buttons, the user can navigate through the dataset, the descriptive
analysis, the probability model analysis and the machine model. If the user chooses one
button, another bar arises where he can select under points for the chosen model. With this
bar, the user decides what will be displayed in the app.
The settings for the calculations are on the left-hand side of the app, the user chooses which
analysis to do displayed in a drop-down menu.
The first feature shows a descriptive analysis of your chosen dataset. Quick insight is shown in
a boxplot and a histogram for the selected column. The user can explore the data set by
summary, missing values, correlation, skewness and kurtosis.
The second feature shows probability models, the user can choose the probability model in a
drop-down menu on the left-hand side. Available models are Bernoulli, binomial, geometric,
multinomial, Poisson and hypergeometric. The user needs to choose a column and prompts
suitable parameters for the intended probability model.
The third feature is the machine learning part, the user has access to three different machine
learning models. Logistic and Poisson Regression Generalized Linear Model for regression
analysis and the Naive Bayes model for classification prediction. The user can choose the size
of the trainset and the test set, with a sliding bar.
